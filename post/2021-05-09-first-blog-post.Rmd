This is my first blog post on the website! I'm going to show a few of the python basics that I learned including having R and Python  talk to each other with reticulate.

*When I finally figured out how to insert this meme.

## Built-in Functions

```{python}
print("hello world")
x = list(range(2,9,2))
len(x)
max(x)
min(x)
type(x)
```

## Slicing Practice
```{python}
plist=list(range(19))
plist
plist[4:6]
plist[::3]
```

## Indexing
```{python}
list1=[2,1,19]
list2=['a','d','d','y']
list2[1]
list1[2]
```

## Reticulate
```{R}
library(reticulate)
Addy <- "Hello"
```

```{python}
Addy = "World"
print(r.Addy,Addy)
```

```{R}
cat(c(Addy,py$Addy))
```
